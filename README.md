# Week-8

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Junit tests and running the program my self. When running it myself I will see if it is working properly and also try and make invalid inputs to ensure errors are handled properly.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Knowing what they intend to use the application for helps the developer(s) understand what they will be making. That way, If the client failed to mention something in their requirements, the development team has a picture of the direction they should go.

How do I approach designing software?
Get the requirements. Ensure I know and understand what is being asked of me. I have used flow charts in the past. They help with some projects, but not all for me. A majority of the time I just get straight into coding. I break down the projects into sperate parts and treat each part like a stand alone project. I ensure each new piece works as intended and with the other sections I have made so far.
